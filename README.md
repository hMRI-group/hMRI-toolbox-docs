# hMRI Toolbox Docs

Sources for the hMRI Toolbox website

## Helpful Information

- If you need to insert a link to the GitHub repository of the Toolbox, don't use `../blob/master/CHANGELOG.md` like before!
  Instead, use `{{repo_url}}/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md`
- If you write `R2*` in Markdown, remember that star means cursive. You have to use `R2\*` instead!
- In every kind of title or section heading, we use ["title case"](https://munch.studio/typography-101-capitalisation-guide) consistently

## Todo

- [ ] Gitter invite link for socials at the bottom
- [ ] Convert bullet points of references in tutorials/references into subsubsections so that we can link to specific papers.
- [ ] In docs/getStarted, the first sentence is "Before using the hMRI Toolbox, please read the README.md and LICENSE files."
      No, this here is going to be the central documentation and everything important will be documented here.
