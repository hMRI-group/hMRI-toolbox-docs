# Local setup

## Virtual environment

Ensure you have Python 3 and the `venv` package. Create the environment by using

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment with

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install all required packages

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next time, you only need to activate the virtual environment again.
