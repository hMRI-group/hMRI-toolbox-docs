# Developing the hMRI Toolbox

The hMRI Toolbox is actively developed by a group of [core developers](../information.md#developers-of-the-hmri-toolbox)
together with contributions from community members.
While most of the new method development happens inside the different scientific groups, some of the core developers
participate in a monthly hackathon were we meet online,
work on features, review pull requests and discuss issues or general software design.

The pages here aim to give users all necessary information on how they can contribute to the hMRI Toolbox.
This is by far not limited to writing code, but also includes improving the toolbox by reporting bugs and suggestions.
For new developers, the guidelines show how to set up their own environment where they can work
on improving the hMRI Toolbox and most importantly, merge it back into the main repository.
