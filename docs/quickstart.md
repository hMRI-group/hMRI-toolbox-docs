# Quick Start

## Download

The latest release (and previous releases and pre-releases) of the hMRI Toolbox Matlab code can be downloaded from the releases page (or just the latest release here).

## Supporting Material

### Wiki-Pages
Online documentation is available as a Wiki. It provides guidelines and instructions for installation and usage of the hMRI Toolbox. These pages are work-in-progress and updated on a regular basis.

### Sample Dataset and MRI Acquisition Protocols
A sample dataset is provided as reference and material for exploring the possibilities and functionalities of the hMRI Toolbox. It is publicly available for download here (Callaghan et al., 2019). Several example MRI protocols (standard MPM protocol using customised Siemens sequences, as well MPM protocol implemented using Siemens and Philips product sequences) as well as a setup (for Siemens 3T MRI) and usage tutorial are available at the same URL. Please be aware that we provide these protocols and information without any warranty. They must be considered work-in-progress, possibly non-optimal protocols and information.
