## Issue Tracking and Bug Reporting

If you believe you have uncovered a bug, [opening an issue](https://github.com/hMRI-group/hMRI-toolbox/issues/new/choose)
on GitHub is the recommended way to proceed.
However, it's always a good idea to browse [open issues](https://github.com/hMRI-group/hMRI-toolbox/issues)
or ask on the mailing list or the chat first.

Please refer to the [Develop and Contribute page](development/contribute.md#issue-tracking) for detailed information on how to 
report issues with all necessary information for us to reproduce it.
